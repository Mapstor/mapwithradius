## How to Draw a Radius on a Map

Drawing a radius on a map takes three steps:

**Step 1: Choose your center point.** Type an address, city, or zip code in the search bar — or click "Use My Location" to center the radius on your current GPS position. You can also click anywhere on the map to place your center point manually.

**Step 2: Set your distance.** Enter the radius distance you need and select your unit (miles, kilometers, meters, or feet). Use the quick presets for common distances like 5 miles, 10 km, or 50 miles. The circle appears instantly on the map.

**Step 3: Adjust and share.** Drag the circle to reposition it. Drag the edge to resize. Change the color to distinguish multiple circles. When you're done, copy the shareable link — anyone who opens it sees your exact map with all circles intact.

## What Can You Do With This Radius Map Tool?

This tool draws a circle on a map at a specific distance from any point. That circle represents every location within that straight-line distance from your center point — also known as an "as the crow flies" radius.

Here are some common ways people use it:

**Check what's within a distance from you.** Enter your home address, set a 10-mile radius, and see exactly how far 10 miles extends in every direction. This helps with commute planning, understanding delivery zones, or answering "how far is 10 miles from me?" visually.

**Compare multiple locations.** Add circles around two or more addresses to see where they overlap. Useful for finding a meeting point, comparing service areas, or choosing between apartments based on proximity to work.

**Define a service or delivery area.** Businesses use radius maps to establish coverage zones. Draw a 25-mile radius around your office to define where you'll accept service calls, or set a 5 km radius for food delivery.

**Visualize specific distances.** It's difficult to picture what "50 miles" actually looks like on a map. Drawing a radius makes it immediately clear — you can see which cities, highways, and landmarks fall within that distance.

**Plan travel and relocation.** Moving to a new city? Draw a radius around your workplace to see which neighborhoods are within a comfortable commute distance. Pair this with our **[drive time map tool](/drive-time-map)** for more accurate travel-time estimates.

## Radius Quick Reference

The table below shows common radius distances and what they typically cover. Use the presets in the tool above to draw any of these instantly.

| Radius | Approximate Area | Typical Coverage | Common Uses |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|-------------|
| 1 mile (1.6 km) | 3.1 sq mi | A neighborhood | Walking distance, small delivery zones |
| 3 miles (4.8 km) | 28 sq mi | A small town | Local errands, school catchment areas |
| 5 miles (8 km) | 78 sq mi | A city section | Commute radius, restaurant delivery |
| 10 miles (16 km) | 314 sq mi | A metro area | Service area, daily commute |
| 25 miles (40 km) | 1,963 sq mi | A region | Regional sales territory |
| 50 miles (80 km) | 7,854 sq mi | Multiple cities | Day trip planning, logistics |
| 100 miles (161 km) | 31,416 sq mi | A large region | Freight radius, weekend trips |

## Common Radius Distances Explained

Below is a detailed breakdown of the most frequently searched radius distances. Each section includes what that distance typically covers and common reasons people search for it. Click any preset in the tool above to draw these instantly.

### 1 Mile Radius
A 1-mile radius covers approximately 3.1 square miles — roughly the size of a neighborhood. In a city, this typically spans 15–20 blocks in any direction. A 1-mile radius is the standard "walking distance" benchmark, representing about a 20-minute walk at an average pace. Common uses: checking what's within walking distance of your home, defining a small delivery zone, or verifying if a property is within 1 mile of a school (relevant for certain zoning regulations and sex offender registry requirements in some US states).

### 3 Mile Radius
A 3-mile radius covers about 28 square miles. In suburban areas, this typically encompasses a small town center and surrounding residential neighborhoods. It's a common radius for restaurant food delivery services and represents roughly a 5–8 minute drive depending on traffic. Many local business directories use a 3-mile radius as their default "nearby" range.

### 5 Mile Radius
A 5-mile radius covers approximately 78 square miles. This is the most commonly drawn radius distance on our tool. It represents a comfortable daily commute range in urban areas (10–15 minutes by car) and is widely used for service area definitions. Real estate agents frequently use a 5-mile radius to show clients what amenities are near a property. Quick-service restaurant chains often define their primary trade area as a 5-mile radius around each location.

### 10 Mile Radius
A 10-mile radius covers about 314 square miles — large enough to encompass most mid-sized metro areas. This is a standard service area radius for many home service businesses (plumbing, electrical, HVAC) and represents a 15–25 minute drive in typical conditions. Insurance companies sometimes use a 10-mile radius to define local coverage zones.

### 25 Mile Radius
A 25-mile radius covers nearly 2,000 square miles. At this scale, the radius begins to include multiple cities and towns. Common uses include regional sales territory planning, defining a "local" hiring area, and franchise territory mapping. The US Department of Agriculture uses a 25-mile radius in some rural food access studies.

### 50 Mile Radius
A 50-mile radius covers approximately 7,854 square miles — enough to span multiple counties in most states. This is the most popular large-radius query we see. It's commonly used for day trip planning ("what cities are within 50 miles of me?"), regional logistics, and understanding the geographic scope of a half-day drive. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) uses a 50-mile radius for certain airspace designations.

### 100 Mile Radius
A 100-mile radius covers over 31,000 square miles. At this scale, the circle covers a significant portion of a state or multiple states. The 100-mile radius is notable in US immigration law — US Customs and Border Protection claims certain expanded search authority within 100 miles of any US border (including coastlines), which covers roughly two-thirds of the US population. It's also a common radius for weekend trip planning and long-distance commute limits.

### 150 Air Mile Radius
The 150 air-mile radius has a specific legal meaning in US trucking. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) provides a "short-haul exemption" for commercial drivers who operate within a 150 air-mile radius of their work reporting location — these drivers are exempt from certain electronic logging device (ELD) requirements. "Air miles" means straight-line distance, which is exactly what our radius tool calculates. Source: **[FMCSA Hours of Service regulations](https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/hours-service/eld/driver-hours-service-short-haul-exception)**

### 200–500 Mile Radius
Radii at 200+ miles are typically used for large-scale logistics planning, warehouse distribution zones, and regional market analysis. A 500-mile radius from a central warehouse (e.g., located in Indianapolis) can cover roughly one-third of the US population, which is why many national distribution networks use this as a planning benchmark.

## Radius From Your Location

Click "Use My Location" in the tool above, and the map centers on your current GPS position with a radius circle already drawn. This is the fastest way to answer questions like:

- "What's within 10 miles of me?"
- "How far is 5 miles from my location?"
- "Show me a 50-mile radius from where I am"

Your location is determined by your browser's geolocation API. On mobile devices, this uses GPS for high accuracy. On desktop computers, it uses your IP address or Wi-Fi, which may be less precise. Your location data is never stored or sent to any server — it stays entirely in your browser.

**[Internal link: Need a metric radius? → Use our KM radius map](/km-radius-map)**

## How This Tool Works

Map With Radius uses **[Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)**, an open-source mapping library, with map tiles from **[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)**. Unlike tools that depend on Google Maps, this means:

- **No usage limits.** Google Maps API charges per load after a free tier. Our tool has no API costs, so there are no restrictions on how many circles you draw or how often you use it.
- **No API key required.** You don't need an account, API key, or any setup. Open the page and start drawing.
- **Fast loading.** Leaflet is lightweight (~40KB) compared to the Google Maps JavaScript API (~200KB+). The map loads faster, especially on mobile.
- **Privacy-first.** No Google tracking. Your map interactions stay in your browser.

The radius circles are calculated using the **[Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula)**, which accounts for the Earth's curvature. This means the circles are geographically accurate — a 50-mile radius really is 50 miles from the center point in every direction, even at high latitudes where map projections can distort distances.

Address search is powered by **[Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/)**, OpenStreetMap's free geocoding service. It supports addresses, cities, zip/postal codes, landmarks, and coordinates.

## How Big Is a Mile? Interactive Distance Visualizer

*[This is a standalone interactive section built as a React/Leaflet component embedded in the page. It serves as a link-worthy asset — uniquely useful content that other sites will want to reference and link to.]*

**How it works:** A slider lets you drag from 0.1 miles to 500 miles. As you drag, a circle on the map grows or shrinks in real time centered on your location (or a default city). Below the map, dynamic text updates:

- "A **5-mile radius** covers **78 sq mi** — that's roughly the size of **Washington, D.C.**"
- "A **50-mile radius** covers **7,854 sq mi** — that's roughly the size of **New Jersey**."
- "A **100-mile radius** covers **31,416 sq mi** — about the size of **South Carolina**."
- "A **250-mile radius** covers **196,350 sq mi** — about the size of **Spain**."

**Size comparisons data (real, verified):**

| Radius | Area (sq mi) | Comparable to |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| 1 mi | 3.1 | ~80 football fields |
| 3 mi | 28 | Manhattan island (23 sq mi) |
| 5 mi | 78 | Washington, D.C. (68 sq mi) |
| 10 mi | 314 | New York City (303 sq mi) |
| 25 mi | 1,963 | Delaware (1,982 sq mi) |
| 50 mi | 7,854 | New Jersey (7,354 sq mi) |
| 100 mi | 31,416 | South Carolina (30,061 sq mi) |
| 150 mi | 70,686 | North Dakota (69,001 sq mi) |
| 250 mi | 196,350 | Spain (195,360 sq mi) |
| 500 mi | 785,398 | Mexico (761,610 sq mi) |

*All state/country areas from the US Census Bureau and World Bank. Radius areas calculated using πr².*

This visualization is designed to be referenced and linked to by educators, bloggers, journalists, and anyone writing about distance or area. It answers a genuinely interesting question with an interactive tool that can't be replicated in a static article.

**Can I draw a radius on Google Maps?**
Google Maps does not have a built-in radius tool. You cannot draw a circle directly in Google Maps or Google My Maps without workarounds involving KML files. Use our tool instead — it works with OpenStreetMap and lets you draw radius circles instantly. **[Read our full guide on radius on Google Maps →](/radius-on-google-maps)**

**How do I find what's within a 10-mile radius of my location?**
Click "Use My Location" in the tool above, then set the radius to 10 miles. The circle shows everything within 10 miles of your current position. You can zoom in to see specific streets, landmarks, and neighborhoods within the radius.

**Is this tool really free?**
Yes. Map With Radius is completely free with no limits. There's no account to create, no premium tier, and no usage cap. The tool runs on open-source technology (Leaflet + OpenStreetMap) which has no per-use costs.

**What's the difference between a radius and drive time?**
A radius shows straight-line distance from a point — "as the crow flies." Drive time shows how far you can actually travel by road in a given time. A 10-mile radius is a perfect circle, but a 10-minute drive is an irregular shape that follows roads. We offer both: this tool for radius circles, and our **[drive time map](/drive-time-map)** for travel-time areas.

**Can I share my radius map with someone?**
Yes. Click "Copy Link" to get a URL that contains your exact map settings — center point, radius distance, and circle positions. Anyone who opens the link sees your map exactly as you set it up.

**How accurate is the radius?**
The radius uses the Haversine formula, which accounts for the Earth's curvature. At typical scales (1–500 miles), accuracy is within a few meters. The circles represent straight-line distance, not road distance.

**Can I add multiple radius circles?**
Yes. Click "Add Another Circle" to place additional circles on the same map. Each circle can have its own center point, radius distance, and color. This is useful for comparing coverage areas or finding overlap between locations.

**Does this work on my phone?**
Yes. The tool is fully responsive and works on all modern browsers, including Safari on iOS and Chrome on Android. Touch and drag to pan the map, pinch to zoom, and tap to place circles.

**Can I export the map?**
You can export in three ways: (1) Copy a shareable URL link, (2) Download a PNG screenshot of your current map view, (3) Export circle data as a KML file that you can open in Google Earth or other GIS software.
