- **Title:** Zip Code Radius Map — Find Zip Codes Within a Radius (Free)
- **Description:** Enter a zip code and distance to find all zip codes within that radius. Export the list as CSV. Free, no signup.
- **H1:** Zip Code Radius Map
- **Keywords:** zip code radius tool (390), radius around zip code (1,900), zip radius map (720), zip code finder radius (320), 36 kws total

## SUBHEADING
Enter a zip code and distance — get a list of every zip code within that radius.

## TOOL BEHAVIOR
Same Leaflet map, but overlays zip code boundaries. Input: zip code + radius distance. Output: map with highlighted zip codes + sortable list panel showing: zip code, city, state, distance from center. Export list as CSV.

## CONTENT BELOW TOOL

### How It Works
Enter a US zip code in the search field and set your radius distance. The tool finds your zip code's center point, draws a radius circle, and identifies every zip code whose boundary falls within (or overlaps) that circle. Results appear both on the map (highlighted boundaries) and in a list panel you can sort and export.

### When to Use Zip Code Radius Search
Zip code radius search is commonly used in marketing (targeting mailers or ads to zip codes near a location), sales territory planning (assigning reps to zip codes within a drive radius), event planning (inviting attendees within a geographic range), and real estate analysis (comparing property markets across nearby zip codes).

### Zip Code vs. Straight-Line Radius
A zip code radius returns whole zip codes — it doesn't split a zip code in half. If any part of a zip code boundary falls within your radius, the entire zip code is included. This means the actual covered area may be slightly larger than your specified radius.

For a precise circular radius without zip code boundaries, use our main **[radius map tool](/)**.

### FAQ
**How many zip codes are in the database?** The tool includes all active US zip codes (approximately 41,000+). Data sourced from the US Census Bureau's ZCTA (Zip Code Tabulation Areas) dataset.

**Can I use postal codes outside the US?** Currently, this tool supports US zip codes only. For radius drawing in other countries, use our main **[radius map tool](/)** with an address search.

**Can I export the zip code list?** Yes. Click "Export CSV" to download a spreadsheet with all zip codes within your radius, including city, state, and distance from center.

## CONTENT BELOW TOOL

### Radius Map in Kilometers
This is the metric version of our **[radius map tool](/)**. It defaults to kilometers for users who work in metric units — which is most of the world outside the United States and United Kingdom. All features are identical: address search, multiple circles, drag to resize, shareable links, and export.

### Common KM Radius Distances

| Radius | Approximate Area | Equivalent in Miles |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1 km | 3.14 km² | 0.62 miles |
| 5 km | 78.5 km² | 3.1 miles |
| 10 km | 314 km² | 6.2 miles |
| 25 km | 1,963 km² | 15.5 miles |
| 50 km | 7,854 km² | 31.1 miles |
| 100 km | 31,416 km² | 62.1 miles |

### FAQ
**Is this different from the main radius tool?** No — it's the same tool with kilometers as the default unit. You can switch to miles at any time using the unit toggle.

**Does address search work outside the US?** Yes. The search is powered by OpenStreetMap's Nominatim, which supports addresses worldwide in any language.

- **Title:** Walking & Cycling Radius Map — How Far Can You Walk or Bike? (Free)
- **Description:** See how far you can walk or cycle in 5, 10, 15, or 30 minutes. Shows real walking/biking area based on actual roads and paths.
- **H1:** Walking & Cycling Radius Map
- **Keywords:** walking radius map, walking distance calculator, bike radius map, cycling distance map, 62 kws total

## SUBHEADING
See how far you can actually walk or cycle in a given time — based on real roads and paths.

## TOOL BEHAVIOR
Isochrone tool (like drive-time-map) but defaults to walking mode. Toggle: 🚶 Walk · 🚴 Cycle. Time presets: 5 min · 10 min · 15 min · 20 min · 30 min · 45 min · 1 hr. Optional: overlay a straight-line radius circle for comparison.

## CONTENT BELOW TOOL

### Walking Radius vs. Straight-Line Radius
A walking radius map shows the area you can actually reach on foot within a time limit — it follows sidewalks, paths, crosswalks, and walkable streets. A **[straight-line radius](/)** shows a perfect circle based on distance "as the crow flies." The difference can be dramatic: a 15-minute walk might cover only 0.7 miles in a grid-pattern city, but the straight-line distance is roughly 1.2 km in every direction.

### How Walking Distance Is Calculated
The tool uses a default walking speed of 5 km/h (3.1 mph), which is a moderate pace for an average adult. It routes along pedestrian-accessible paths from OpenStreetMap data, excluding highways, motorways, and roads without sidewalks where applicable.

Factors that affect your actual walking radius: terrain and elevation changes, traffic signals and crosswalks (the tool does not account for wait times), weather conditions, and personal walking speed.

### How Cycling Distance Is Calculated
The cycling mode uses a default speed of 15 km/h (9.3 mph) and prioritizes bike lanes, cycling paths, and bike-friendly roads. It avoids highways and roads typically closed to cyclists.

### The 15-Minute Walk Standard
Urban planners frequently use the "15-minute city" concept — the idea that essential services (grocery, school, healthcare, transit) should be within a 15-minute walk. A 15-minute walking isochrone from your home shows what you can access on foot and is a useful way to evaluate neighborhood walkability.

### Common Walking and Cycling Times

| Time | Walking Distance (approx) | Cycling Distance (approx) |
|------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| 5 min | 400 m / 0.25 mi | 1.2 km / 0.75 mi |
| 10 min | 800 m / 0.5 mi | 2.5 km / 1.5 mi |
| 15 min | 1.2 km / 0.75 mi | 3.7 km / 2.3 mi |
| 30 min | 2.4 km / 1.5 mi | 7.5 km / 4.7 mi |

### FAQ
**Can I change the walking speed?** The default is 5 km/h. A speed adjustment feature may be added based on user feedback.

**Does this account for hills?** The routing follows real roads and paths. Significant elevation changes may slow actual walking speed, but the tool uses a flat-terrain speed estimate.

# PAGE: /distance-calculator
## META
- **Title:** Distance Between Two Points on a Map — Free Calculator
- **Description:** Measure the straight-line or driving distance between any two points on a map. Shows both "as the crow flies" and road distance.
- **H1:** Distance Between Two Points
- **Keywords:** distance between two points (1,600+), distance between two addresses (3,600), distance calculator, as the crow flies, 22 kws total

## SUBHEADING
Click two points on the map to measure the distance between them — straight line and by road.

## TOOL BEHAVIOR
Leaflet map. Click point A → click point B → shows: (1) straight-line distance with a dashed line, (2) road distance with the actual route drawn. Results panel shows both values in miles and km. Option to add more points for multi-stop measurement.

## CONTENT BELOW TOOL

### Straight-Line vs. Road Distance
This tool shows two measurements between your selected points:

**Straight-line distance** (also called "as the crow flies," great-circle distance, or aerial distance) is the shortest possible distance between two points on Earth's surface. It's calculated using the Haversine formula and ignores roads, terrain, and obstacles.

**Road distance** is the actual distance you'd travel by car following roads. This is always longer than straight-line distance — typically 20–40% longer, though it can be much more in mountainous areas or where roads take indirect routes.

### When Each Measurement Matters
Straight-line distance is used in aviation, shipping regulations (e.g., the 150 air-mile radius for trucking exemptions), insurance zone calculations, and quick distance estimates. Road distance is what matters for driving, delivery planning, and fuel calculations.

### FAQ
**Is this more accurate than Google Maps?** For road distance, accuracy is comparable — both use detailed road network data. For straight-line distance, our tool explicitly calculates and displays it, while Google Maps only shows driving distance by default.

**Can I measure distance between more than two points?** Yes. Click additional points to create a multi-stop route. The tool shows cumulative distance.

### MapDevelopers
MapDevelopers' Draw Circle Tool is one of the most popular radius tools online. It's simple, fast, and reliable. Multiple circles, drag-to-reposition, customizable colors. Its main limitations are the lack of KML export, no PNG download, and a dated visual design. It runs on Google Maps.

Source: **[MapDevelopers — Draw a Circle](https://www.mapdevelopers.com/draw-circle-tool.php)**

### CalcMaps
CalcMaps offers a clean interface with preset radius options (1 mi, 5 mi, 10 mi, etc.). The free version is limited — multiple circles, printing, and downloading require a PRO subscription at $9.99/month. Good for occasional single-circle use.

Source: **[CalcMaps — Map Radius](https://www.calcmaps.com/map-radius/)**

### Smappen
Smappen is a business-focused geomarketing platform. It offers radius maps, isochrones, demographic data, and territory management. Excellent for businesses doing location analysis, but overkill for someone who just needs to draw a circle on a map. Requires an account and has paid plans for full features.

- **H1:** Geofence Map Tool
- **Keywords:** geofence map tool, google map geofencing, geofence radius, 22 kws, 460 vol

## CONTENT

### What Is a Geofence?
A geofence is a virtual boundary around a real-world location. When a device (usually a smartphone) enters or exits the geofence, it triggers an action — like sending a notification, logging the event, or adjusting app behavior. Geofences are typically circular, defined by a center point and a radius.

Source: **[Wikipedia — Geo-fence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo-fence)**

### How Geofencing Works
Geofencing uses GPS, Wi-Fi, cellular data, or Bluetooth to determine a device's location. When the device's coordinates fall within (or outside) the defined boundary, the geofence is "triggered." Common geofence radius sizes range from 100 meters (for store-level targeting) to several kilometers (for regional boundaries).

### Creating a Basic Geofence with Our Tool
While our **[radius map tool](/)** isn't a full geofencing platform (it doesn't track devices or trigger actions), it's useful for the planning and visualization step:

1. Open the **[radius tool](/)** and enter the center location of your desired geofence.
2. Set the radius to your desired geofence size.
3. Visualize the area and adjust as needed.
4. Export as KML to import into your geofencing platform or development environment.

For implementing actual geofencing (with device tracking and triggers), you'll need a development platform like Google's Geofencing API (Android), Apple's Core Location (iOS), or a third-party service like Radar.io or PlotProjects.

### Common Geofence Sizes

| Use Case | Typical Radius | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Retail store entry | 50–200 m | Trigger when customer approaches |
| Restaurant / local business | 200–500 m | Nearby notifications |
| Campus / facility | 500 m – 2 km | Employee check-in |
| City-level targeting | 5–25 km | Regional marketing |
| Compliance / regulatory | Varies | E.g., 150 air-mile radius for trucking |

### FAQ
**Can I use this tool for actual geofencing?** This tool is for visualization and planning. To create a functioning geofence that triggers events on devices, you need a geofencing SDK or platform integrated into a mobile app.
